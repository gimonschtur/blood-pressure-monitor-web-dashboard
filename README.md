BP Monitor Dashboard
 
Version 1.0 | January 9, 2017

Software requirements:
* MongoDB
* NodeJS
* NPM

Note:
Before running server.js on node, please run mongod.exe (for my PC, it's located in C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin) and execute "npm install" first on the command line and in the same directory as the server.js.
